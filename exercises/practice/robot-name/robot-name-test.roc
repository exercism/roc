import RobotName exposing [createFactory, createRobot, boot, reset, getName, getFactory]

### Let's start by testing the basic robot workflow

# A new robot must not have a name
expect
    factory = createFactory { seed: 0 }
    robot = factory |> createRobot
    result = robot |> getName
    result |> Result.isErr

# After the first boot, a robot must have a name
expect
    factory = createFactory { seed: 0 }
    robot = factory |> createRobot |> boot
    result = robot |> getName
    result |> Result.isOk

# Rebooting a robot should leave its name unchanged
expect
    factory = createFactory { seed: 0 }
    robot = factory |> createRobot |> boot
    name1 = robot |> getName
    name2 = robot |> boot |> getName
    name1 == name2

# After it is factory reset (which also reboots), a robot must have a  name
expect
    factory = createFactory { seed: 0 }
    robot = factory |> createRobot |> boot |> reset
    result = robot |> getName
    result |> Result.isOk

# After it is factory reset, a robot must have a new name. If by chance it
# is the same (you should buy a lottery ticket today), we can try again to get
# a new name. If it's the same again we can be pretty confident that there's a
# problem.
expect
    factory = createFactory { seed: 0 }
    robot = factory |> createRobot |> boot
    name1 = robot |> getName
    name2 = robot |> reset |> getName
    name3 = robot |> reset |> reset |> getName
    name1 != name2 || name1 != name3

# If you factory reset a new robot, since this includes a boot, the robot
# should have a name
expect
    factory = createFactory { seed: 0 }
    robot = factory |> createRobot |> reset
    result = robot |> getName
    result |> Result.isOk

# Once created, a robot's name must be 5 characters long
expect
    factory = createFactory { seed: 0 }
    robot = factory |> createRobot |> boot
    result = robot |> getName |> Result.try \n -> n |> Str.toUtf8 |> List.len |> Ok
    result == Ok 5

### Next we will try to ensure that the random names are sufficiently diverse.
### For this, we will first create many robot names.

## Create many robots using a given random seed, and return their names
## encoded using Str.toUtf8.
## The default quantity is 1,000, which is enough to offer strong statistical
## guarantees in the tests below, for example the probability that any letter
## or digit is absent from all names is negligible.

                Err NoName -> crash "A robot must have a name after the first boot"

# The same seed must generate the same robot names
expect

# technically possible for the two lists to be identical, but the probability
# is negligible when the lists are long enough).

### Finally, we will try to ensure that the characters are not linearly
### correlated within each name or across consecutive names. This does not
### guarantee that the names are truly random, but at least it should rule out
### many types of non-random sequences (e.g., such as simply incrementing a
### counter).

## The R² correlation coefficient, also known as the coefficient of determination,
## measures the degree of linear correlation between two lists of numbers.
## It ranges from -∞ to +1.0.
## When both lists are strongly linearly correlated, R² approaches +1.0.
## When both lists are long and independently drawn from the same random
## distribution, R² approaches -1.0.
