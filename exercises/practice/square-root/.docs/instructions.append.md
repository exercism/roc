This problem can be solved easily using Roc's built-in `Num` module, including the [`Num.sqrt`][sqrt] function.

However, we'd like you to consider the challenge of solving this exercise without using built-ins or modules.

While there is a mathematical formula that will find the square root of _any_ number, we have gone the route of having only [natural numbers][natural-number] (positive integers) as solutions.
