Exercism exercises in Roc.

## Testing

To test all exercises, run `./bin/verify-exercises`.
This command will iterate over all exercises and check to see if their exemplar/example implementation passes all the tests.

To test a single exercise, run `./bin/verify-exercises <exercise-slug>`.

### Track linting

[`configlet`](https://exercism.org/docs/building/configlet) is an Exercism-wide tool for working with tracks. You can download it by running:

```shell
$ ./bin/fetch-configlet
```

Run its [`lint` command](https://exercism.org/docs/building/configlet/lint) to verify if all exercises have all the necessary files and if config files are correct:

```shell
$ ./bin/configlet lint

The lint command is under development.
Please re-run this command regularly to see if your track passes the latest linting rules.
